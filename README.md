# Abstract

A React app to create users, add, edit and delete exercises associated with the user's profile.

The app uses MongoDB, Axios, create-react-app and Express with node to make this happen.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the react app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

In the backend directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the express node server at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). It also makes use of MongoDB atlas to maintain persistent data state remotely.
Running the backend server is essential for the front end react app to make any requests to modify/access data to and from mongodb.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app is modeled after Beau Carnes' MERN stack video on freecodecamp.
